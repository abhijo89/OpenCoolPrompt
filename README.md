Open Cool Prompt
=============
A windows utility that loads `cmd` prompt for a folder by right-clicking on it.

Was created by me almost 3 years back(August 04, 2009). Decided to upload it today(July 4, 2012).

How to install?
-------
To install double-click or execute the file named `Install.VBS`.

What will be installed?
-------
Once installed there will be shortcuts in Desktop and Start Menu folders. Also a context-menu(i.e., right-click menu) is added. It could be seen only when user right clicks on a directory. This context-menu is added through Windows registry.

How to uninstall?
-------
Similar to installing process, to unistall double-click or execute the file named `Uninstall.VBS`.

What will be uninstalled?
-------
All Registry entries and shortcuts will be deleted. The script, batch and READ ME files(this document) needs to be deleted by the user.

Uses of this application:
-------
* For programmers this application serves as the quick access to any directories where is not registered in PATH variable so that he/she can run executables found in that path. Good example is `Cobol-85` Standard compiler which cannot be run even with PATH variable set outside its own directory.

* For other users, this application can be used for multitude of tasks such as to command-line based audio/video encoding/transcoding, copying, deleting files within the selected directories, etc ...
